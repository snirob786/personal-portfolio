      "Me and my team built Wozaif, an AI-powered job portal mobile application by WOZAIF PORTAL CO LLC in Dubai, UAE, connects job seekers and employers through a transparent, bilingual platform built with AWS Amplify and AWS Lambda for serverless operations, AWS AppSync for GraphQL APIs, and MongoDB for data storage. It features secure authentication via AWS Cognito with OTP through AWS SES, Google, and Facebook logins, AI-driven job matching using OpenAIâ€™s latest model trained on a custom dataset, and voice-to-text job searches with AWS Transcribe. The app fetches job data from Google Sheets, generates PDF job offers, and sends them via AWS SES, all within a responsive English/Arabic interface crafted with React.js and i18n libraries.",

      "As part of a team, I contributed to designing and developing a full-stack web app for Ticket Tomorrow, an entertainment and ticketing platform in Bangladesh. We built the UI using NextJS, TypeScript, Material UI, TailwindCSS, Google Maps, Sun-Editor, and React Slick, ensuring multilingual support and an ad-free experience. The backend was developed using AWS Lambda, TypeScript, AWS DynamoDB, AWS AppSync for GraphQL APIs, AWS Cognito for secure authentication, AWS SES for email notifications, and AWS S3 for storage. The app promotes events, manages ticket sales, and integrates payment methods like bKash and Nagad.
